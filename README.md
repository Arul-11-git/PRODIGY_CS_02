# PRODIGY_CS_02

Python Libraries: The project utilizes Python libraries such as PIL (Python Imaging Library) or its successor Pillow for image manipulation tasks. These libraries provide essential functionalities for loading, saving, and processing image data, which are fundamental for implementing encryption and decryption algorithms.

Encryption Algorithms: Python allows for the implementation of various encryption algorithms directly within the code. Common algorithms used for image encryption include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman), and symmetric key algorithms like Blowfish or Twofish. These algorithms ensure that the image data is scrambled in a way that only authorized parties with the correct decryption key can recover the original image.

Encryption Process: Within the Python environment, the project involves reading the pixel data from the input image file, applying the selected encryption algorithm along with a secure key, and then saving the encrypted data back into an image file format. This process ensures that even if the encrypted image is intercepted or accessed by unauthorized entities, the original image content remains protected and unreadable.

Decryption Process: Conversely, the decryption process in Python involves reading the encrypted image file, applying the corresponding decryption algorithm with the correct decryption key, and reconstructing the original image from the decrypted pixel data. Python's ability to handle complex mathematical operations and byte-level manipulations efficiently facilitates this process.

User Interface (Optional): Depending on the project's scope, a graphical user interface (GUI) can be developed using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt to provide a user-friendly interaction for selecting images, encryption algorithms, and keys. This enhances usability and accessibility, especially for users who may not be familiar with command-line interfaces.
